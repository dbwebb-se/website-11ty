Unix lab introduction
==================================

During the course you will perform a set of laborations where you practice your skills in different areas.

<!--more-->



Instructions {#instructions}
-----------------------

### Get the lab {#get}

The lab is automatically generated for you. Here's how to check out your personal lab.

Go to your course directory in the terminal and run the command for your lab.

```bash
$ dbwebb create <lab>
```

Instead of `<lab>` you type the name of the lab ie `$ dbwebb create bash1`.

The material for the lab is now created and stored in your course catalog as follows.

| File               | Content                                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `instruction.html` | Description of the lab and the tasks to be done.               |
| `answer.bash`      | Here you should write your code to solve each task in the lab. |

Open the file `instruction.html` in a web browser and read through the information covered by the lab.

Open the file `answer.bash` in your text editor and code the answers to the questions.

Some labs requires an additional file or folder which will reside in the lab directory and automatically downloaded for you.



### Test lab {#test}

You can test your solutions by running the program `answer.bash` in your terminal.

```bash
$ ./answer.bash
```



### Hand in the lab {#handin}

To hand in the lab, execute the following command:

```bash
dbwebb publish <lab>
```

Instead of `<lab>` you type the name of the lab ie `$ dbwebb publish bash1`.

Correct any errors that pop up and publish again. When it looks green you are done. You also have an indication at the bottom where the score is shown.



Laborations {#labs}

```bash
$ dbwebb create bash2
```

Enter your bash code within `$ ()` to execute and return the response, eg:

```bash
ANSWER=$( find . -name 'filename' )
