Assignment: Risk analysis
====================

This is a mandatory assignment that you are supposed to solve groupwise.



Introduction
------------------------

Perform a Risk Analysis for the project.



Resources
------------------------

There is a session held that prepares you for this assignment by first helding a **lecture** on the topic where a "method for risk analysis" is introduced.

Then a **workshop** is carried out on how to execute a risk analysis. The result from the workshop provides a startpoint for your team to work further on.



Requirements
------------------------

Each team executes their risk analysis and the may use the result from the workshop to start with. You should remove the risks that is not valid for your team.

Document something like 10, 15, 20 risks and discuss them in your team. Assess and evaluate each risk according to the "method" presented in the lecture.

It is not the number of risks that are important, it is more "what" risks you choose to focus on and prioritizes.

Try to find risks that cover several aspects of your project and includes all (or some) of the different stakeholders you have for the project.

Focus on technical and implementation risks in detail. What will hinder you from making the delivery on time?

When you are done, sort the risks (according to your own algoritm of sorting) so the most important risks are on top and the less important risks at the bottom.

You decide in your team what you think is the most important risks to focus on.



Submission
------------------------

It is a group submission.

Submit the link to the excelsheet, or the excelsheet itself.

Write a few lines reflections on how you feel that the risk analysis worked out for your team and how it was to carry it out. Any immediate observations you made that might improve the project results?



Examination
------------------------

The teacher will grade your submission G, Ux or U and provide short feedback on Canvas.
