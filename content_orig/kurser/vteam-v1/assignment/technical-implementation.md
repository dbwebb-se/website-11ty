Assignment: Technical implementation decisions
====================

This is a mandatory assignment that you are supposed to solve groupwise.



Introduction
------------------------

Show off the technical decisions you have made for your implementation of the project.



Requirements
------------------------

Write a short text about the techniques you are using in your project for the implementation of the system.

The idea is that all the teams write a short text which is then spread to all the teams so all can see what different technique choices are made for backend, frontend, frameworks, languages, devtools and ci/cd.

Do not write more than "half a A4" page of text, so be condensed with the text and no images.

Think that you are writing to let your fellow programmer collegues know about your choices so that they may learn from it.



Submission
------------------------

It is a group submission.

Submit the text to Canvas.



Examination
------------------------

The teacher will grade your submission G, Ux or U and say "Thank you" on Canvas.

The teacher will then compile the result and spread it through the teams.
