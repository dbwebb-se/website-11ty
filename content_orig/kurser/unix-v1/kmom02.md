Assignment 2: Bash
==================================

Now let's get acquainted with script programming in Bash.

Much is about simplifying everyday life, as a programmer, by automating the processes and routines you perform. A lot of what we do can be automated through scripts, such as Bash scripts with commands. But to do that, we need to keep track of how to create scripts and how to program in Bash.

You also need to have a pretty good look at common commands in the Linux terminal. There are commands that are powerful and if we only learn a couple of these commands they can save a lot of time for us.
