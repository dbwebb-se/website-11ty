Assignment 4: Mazerunner
==================================

You will get a finished server, written in Node.js, and a RESTful API to the server. The server implements a [*maze*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze). The server is ready and you can test run it via the curl command.

Your task is to build a bash client for the server, according to a requirements specification. Your client should use the server to resolve the maze.

So is the arrangement. Let's see how well the wings carry. The structure of this assignment is "a little freer", so we go almost straight at the task itself.



<!--more-->

This is what it may look like when you solve the maze with your script. Note that the script in this case is called *mazerunner.sh*. You should use the file extension **.bash**. The assignment may be inspired by the book / movie of the same name, [The Maze Runner](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner).

When you have completed all assignments above do the following command to publish all code to the student server.

```

Then on the education platform Canvas do a hand in for assignment 4 with a text containing reflective answers to the questions below.

* Do you feel more comfortable with script programming in Bash?
* How did it feel to write a slightly larger bash script? Was it something that was more or less challenging and time-consuming?
* Did you look at the source code for the maze server? Do you have any reflections on it?
* Are you happy with your mazerunner? Did you do something special that you want to highlight?

Your grade on this assignment and points towards the final grade is given based on the following criteria:

| Grade | Final grade points | Assignments | Reflective answers | Optional assignment in Mazerunner |
|-------|----------|------|------ |------|
| A     | 20       | X    | X     | X
| C     | 15       | X    | X  OR | X
| E     | 10       | X    |       |
| F     | 0        |      |       |

As a last text describe what you have done in this assignment and make an argument for the grade you deserve. The grading of your assignment will use this text as the starting point.
