Assignment 1: Apache Virtual Hosts
==================================

You have installed a Linux server in VirtualBox, now we will start using the server in one of most utilized ways that a Linux server is used: Hosting web pages.

We will use the Apache web server A of the widely known and used web server configuration [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) ( **L**inux - **A**pache - **M**ySQL - **P**HP ). To host the webpages we will use Apache Virtual Hosts.
