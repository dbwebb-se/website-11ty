for-loop
=======================

Most of you probably know how a for-loop is supposed to work. We want to be able to repeat a certain code *n* number of times, or loop through the contents of a data structure.



### for...in


```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# An example script on for...in

# for...in range
for value in 1 2 3 4 5
do
    echo "$value"
done

# for...in range, ({START..END})
for value in {1..5}
do
    echo "$value"
done

# for...in range with steps, ({START..END..INCREMENT})
for value in {1..10..2}
do
    echo "$value"
done

```

An alternative is to use *arithmetic expansion*, `(( ))`. It gives the opportunity to write a more C-like construction. Note that it also works for the conditions in the if statement.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# An example script on traditional for-loop

for (( i=0; i<10; i++ ))
do
    if (( "$i" % 2 == 0 ))
    then
        echo "$i is even"
    else
        echo "$i is odd"
    fi    
done
```
