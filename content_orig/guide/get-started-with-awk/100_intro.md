What is awk?
=======================

**Awk** is a tool and programming language that searches in and processes text. It is used both to retrieve data and to present data. Just like *sed* and *grep*, the tool works as a filter and awk works best on already formatted data, such as spreadsheets (.csv, .xls).

There are different versions of awk and in this course we use the GNU variant *gawk*.
