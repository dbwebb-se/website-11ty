What is regex?
=======================

Regex is an abbreviation of Regular Expression, a well-known tool for matching text patterns. It is usually used to extract information from code, log files and other texts.
In regex, a pattern is defined by characters that regex then tries to find/match in a string or text.

If you find it difficult to understand a regex pattern or you want to test the pattern on a text, quickly and easily, I recommend the page [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/). You enter a pattern and a text. You will get an explanation of the different parts of the pattern.

<!-- There are various tools we can use to handle the expressions and in this course we look at *sed* (Stream Editor). You always have access to the manual, `man sed`. -->
