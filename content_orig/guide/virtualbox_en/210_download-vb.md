Download the installer {#download}
=======================

You can read about [VirtualBox on their website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

There is a section where you can [download the installationprogram](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Download "VirtualBox platform package".

"VirtualBox platform package" is the installationprogram itself for VirtualBox and everything in that package is under GNU license.

There is also a package called "VirtualBox Extension Pack". It contains additional drivers and components that are not covered by the GNU license. You can wait to download it until later.
