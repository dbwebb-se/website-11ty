Download Debian
=======================

You can read about Debian on [the projects website](https://www.debian.org/). There you also find a [section where you download](https://www.debian.org/distrib/) an ISO-image which you can use to install Debian in VirtualBox (or other hardware).

I choose to download their image which is [adapted for installation via internet](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst). It requires a connection to the internet but it is small and fast to download.

Since I plan to install the smallest version of Debian, I do not need a lot of packages or window handlers. So this is a quick and easy way to get started.

I choose from the download links under "Small CDs or USB sticks". I choose *amd64* in cases where I have a 64 bit machine. If I have a 32 bit machine then I choose the package *i386*.

VirtualBox will show you what options you have. In the worst case, you have to download both packages. Start with amd64 for 64-bit. If you can only install 32 bit, download i386 instead.

This is what it looks like when I do these steps.
