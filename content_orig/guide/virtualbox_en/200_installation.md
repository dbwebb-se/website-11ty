Installation
=======================

When I do the installation below I use Windows 10. VirtualBox is dependent on your hardware so some things may differ, but basically it's the same process if you are on a Mac or Linux machine.

The recommendation is that you use a newer computer with at least 6GB of internal memory. Otherwise, the risk is that it will be a little too slow.
